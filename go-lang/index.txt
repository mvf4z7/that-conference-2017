Questions:
1. why init? Just put in first lines of main
2. multiple or dynamic GO_PATH, dont want to share dependencies

Notes:
3. package management, different version for different projects (glide)
  - vendor file  (vendoring)
5. typically use make files for "npm scripts"
6. uppercase and lowercase matter when defining struct types
  - lowercase are not accessible outside of the package the type is defined in

7. parameters are always passed by value (copied), so if you want to mutate the parameter (e.g. a struct)
then you need to pass by reference.

creating instance:

accountOne := a.Account{

  }
}
